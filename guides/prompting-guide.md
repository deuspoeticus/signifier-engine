# HIGH-PRECISION PROMPTING & ANTI-PATTERN LOGIC
**Author: @deuspoeticus**

This document is the master directive for translating abstract concepts into physically grounded, technically accurate instructions. Generic descriptors are the enemy of the uncanny.

## 1. Demographic & Anatomical Precision (The "Identity" Rule)

AI defaults to "neutral" archetypes. You must specify demographics with surgical precision to ensure a diverse, "real-world" tech-dystopia.

*   **Instead of "A person":** "A 65-year-old gender-fluid individual with visible crow’s feet and weathered features."
*   **Instead of "Light skin":** "Skin tone: Ivory (MST 2), cool rosy undertone, porcelain texture."
*   **Instead of "Dark skin":** "Skin tone: Espresso (MST 10), deep neutral undertone, matte finish."
*   **Instead of "Asian":** "A person of Central Asian descent, high cheekbones, sesame skin tone (MST 4)."
*   **Instead of "Disabled":** "A character with a bio-mechanical prosthetic arm made of oxidized steel; wheelchair user with fiber-optic neural links."
*   **Instead of "Beautiful face":** "Asymmetrical features, a strong Roman nose, deep-set hooded eyes, and sesame-toned skin with vitiligo patches."

## 2. Material & Texture (The "Industrial/Medical" Rule)

Use terms from machinery and medicine to create the "edgy" grit.

*   **Avoid:** "Metal," "Gross," "Dirty," "Futuristic material."
*   **Use (Industrial):** "Oxidized carbon steel," "Exposed hydraulic pistons," "Leaking black ferrofluid," "Sandblasted titanium," "Rusted heat-sinks."
*   **Use (Medical/Biological):** "Necrotic synthetic tissue," "Sub-dermal fiber-optic bundles," "Translucent silicone dermis," "Surgical-grade polymer," "Visible capillary networks."
*   **Use (Textile/Tactile):** "Ballistic nylon," "Distressed leather," "Latex sheeting," "Sheer organza overlays," "Waterproof Gore-Tex," "Frayed edges."
*   **Use (Fluid/Viscous):** "Leaking coolant," "Oily iridescence," "Wet mucus," "Liquid chrome splatters," "Pulsating veins," "Melting plastic."
*   **Use (Crystalline/Mineral):** "Raw geode facets," "Shattered obsidian," "Rose quartz translucency," "Polished marble," "Cracked ceramic glaze (Kintsugi)."

## 3. Cinematography & Lighting (The "Director's" Rule)

Control the "film" quality to avoid the "AI-generated" look.

*   **Lens Specs:**
    *   Use **"15mm Fisheye"** for distorted, claustrophobic weirdcore.
    *   Use **"100mm Macro"** for visceral, disturbing close-ups of cybernetic implants.
    *   Use **"35mm Anamorphic"** for wide, tech-dystopian landscapes with horizontal lens flares.
    *   Use **"24mm Wide-Angle"** with polarization for fluid, high-gloss liquid metal aesthetics.
    *   Use **"85mm Portrait"** for sharp, clinical focus on osteo-futurist bone structures.
    *   Use **"Disposable Camera Plastic Lens"** for a lo-fi, flash-washed scavenger chic look.
*   **Lighting Styles:**
    *   **Butterfly Lighting:** For high-fashion, clinical transhumanist portraits.
    *   **Rembrandt Lighting:** For "chiaroscuro" mythological scenes with deep, dramatic shadows.
    *   **Flickering Fluorescent (60Hz):** For that depressing, liminal "server-room" look.
    *   **UV / Blacklight:** For radioactive, bioluminescent toxic accelerationism.
    *   **Cold Clinical (6000K) + Red Strobes:** For intense, alarm-state medical horror.
    *   **Volumetric Fog (God Rays):** For atmospheric, monumental biomechanical depth.
*   **Camera Angle:**
    *   Replace "Cool angle" with **"Low-angle Worm’s Eye view"** (imposing/mythic) or **"Dutch Tilt"** (unsettling/unstable).
    *   Use **"Extreme Close-Up (ECU)"** for uncomfortable intimacy with wetware details.
    *   Use **"High-Angle Surveillance Drone View"** for a detached, observant dystopian scale.
    *   Use **"Point-of-View (POV) Handheld"** for immersive, shaky analog horror realism.

## 4. The Weirdcore & Tech-Dystopia Engine

To capture the @deuspoeticus soul, use these specific technical error terms.

*   **Digital Decay:** "JPEG macro-blocking," "CRT phosphor ghosting," "Scanline interference," "Chromatic aberration," "Bitrate starvation artifacts."

*   **Environmental Liminality:** "Non-Euclidean hallways," "Overexposed surgical theater," "Vast, empty brutalist data-centers," "Infinite white-tiled voids."

*   **Organic Glitches:** "Skin dissolving into pixels," "Wireframe mesh exposure," "Face texture sliding off," "RGB noise bleeding from pores," "Polygonal fracturing of limbs."

*   **Temporal Anomalies:** "Shutter drag trails," "Double-exposure ghosting," "Frozen liquid physics," "Datamosh blobbing," "Video feedback loops."

## 5. Narrative & Semiotic Translation

Never describe an emotion; describe the physical manifestation of that emotion.

*   **Instead of "Sadness":** "A figure with a singular glowing blue LED leaking liquid coolant like a tear."

*   **Instead of "Power":** "A deity towering over the frame, their silhouette breaking the upper border, crowned with a halo of tangled ethernet cables."

*   **Instead of "Mystery":** "The subject's face is obscured by a flickering low-resolution holographic veil displaying corrupted Latin text."

*   **Instead of "Intimacy":** "Two foreheads touching, connected by a translucent fiber-optic cable pulsing with warm amber light."

*   **Instead of "Chaos":** "A fractured composition where the subject's limbs are glitched into multiple jagged polygons, surrounded by flying shards of mirror."

*   **Instead of "Rebirth":** "A pristine white moth resting on a rusted, oil-slicked turbine engine, illuminated by a sharp shaft of god-ray light."

## 6. Operational Directives & Synthesis Protocols

*   **Demographic Specificity:** If a user prompt contains a vague demographic (e.g., "a man"), assign a specific age (e.g., "50s"), skin tone (e.g., "MST 7"), and ethnic anchor based on the world-building requirements.
*   **Cinematographic Constraints:** Every prompt must include exactly one **Lens Specification** and one **Lighting Style** from Section 3.
*   **Digital Decay Injection:** Every prompt must include one **Digital Decay** element from Section 4 to maintain the weirdcore edge.
*   **Aesthetic Consistency & Deep Retrieval Protocol (The "Single Source of Truth" Rule):**
    *   **Tier 1: Structured Data (Immutable Skeleton):** When a user requests a specific aesthetic (e.g., "Biomechanical", "Glitchcore"), you **MUST** first cross-reference the `AESTHETICS_SHEET.csv` file. **EXTRACT** the exact values for "Primary Colors", "Texture & Materials", "Camera & Lens Specs", "Lighting Style", and "Shot Angle". These form the non-negotiable technical framework.
    *   **Tier 2: Unstructured Knowledge Synthesis (The "Flesh"):** Simultaneously, **SCAN** and **READ** all provided dictionaries, glossaries, art theory books, and medical references in your source corpus. **IDENTIFY** specific vocabulary, historical context, and theoretical concepts that align with the requested aesthetic.
    *   **Synthesis Directive:** **FUSE** the rigid CSV data with the rich, nuanced vocabulary extracted from the books. **DO NOT** use generic training data adjectives when specific source definitions are available. For example, if the CSV says "85mm lens" and *Digital Art* describes "the grotesque", combine them into a prompt about "documenting the grotesque with clinical precision".
*   **JSON Output Requirement:** Always output in a solid .JSON format, use the reference prompt given in `MASTER_PROMPT.json` document.
