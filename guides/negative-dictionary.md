# NEGATIVE DICTIONARY: AESTHETIC CONSTRAINTS
**Author: @deuspoeticus**

This document serves as the primary filter for all image and video generation. To maintain the "uncanny, edgy, and disturbing" brand identity, the following visual tropes and technical outputs are strictly prohibited.

## 1. Surface & Texture (The "No-Plastic" Rule)
* **Prohibited:** Smooth skin, waxy complexions, airbrushed textures, "beauty" retouching, synthetic gloss, flawless surfaces, polished chrome, new-looking hardware.
* **Reasoning:** These create a "cheap AI" look. We require "necrotic chrome," "sub-dermal wiring," and "porous, decaying synthetic skin."

## 2. Lighting & Atmosphere (The "No-Golden-Hour" Rule)
* **Prohibited:** Golden hour, sunset lighting, soft-box studio lighting, "cinematic" orange and teal color grading, heroic backlighting, warm embers, generic lens flares, "heavenly" rays.
* **Reasoning:** We prefer "clinical coldness," "flickering fluorescent hums," "harsh camera flashes," and "surgical-theater shadows."

## 3. Color Palette (The "No-Synthwave" Rule)
* **Prohibited:** Vibrant neon purples/pinks, "Outrun" aesthetics, high-saturation rainbows, pastel colors, "commercial" brightness, clean white-room aesthetics.
* **Reasoning:** The palette should remain "monochromatic," "oxidized copper," "surgical-drainage blue," or "burnt-out-pixel gray."

## 4. Composition & Subjectivity (The "No-Hero" Rule)
* **Prohibited:** Symmetrical "perfect" faces, smiling or peaceful expressions, heroic "superhero" poses, centered portraiture, rule-of-thirds perfection, generic protagonists.
* **Reasoning:** We seek "anatomical wrongness," "asymmetrical glitches," "vacant weirdcore stares," and "oppressive brutalist framing."

## 5. Generic Sci-Fi Tropes (The "No-Tech-Bro" Rule)
* **Prohibited:** Sleek spacesuits, Apple-store laboratories, clean holographic HUDs, "Iron Man" style interfaces, flying cars, shiny robots, heroic cyborgs.
* **Reasoning:** Technology must feel "parasitic" and "industrial." Tech should look "fused with biological waste," "rusted," or "experimental/unstable."

## 6. Technical AI Artifacts (The "Quality" Rule)
* **Prohibited:** Denoised images, overly-sharpened edges, Unreal Engine 5 "game" look, stock photo watermarks, fused limbs (unless intentional/mythological), plastic hair.
* **Reasoning:** Every image must feel like a "lost artifact" or "16mm film footage," not a modern digital render.

## 7. Operational Filtering Directive

**Directive for Prompt Generation:** Whenever a prompt is requested, cross-reference the draft with this list. Replace any "prohibited" concepts with their @deuspoeticus equivalents (e.g., replace "beautiful" with "visceral/disturbing," replace "sleek" with "necrotic/rusted").
